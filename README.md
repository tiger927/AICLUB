# AICLUB AGENDA
1. Setup the projector (*I did not even set it up yet, so finger cross that this won't take the entire period*)

2. Vote on team name (*Not everybody is gonna be there, so might just be temporary*)

3. Talk about the foundation and basics of this club such as the goals, the possibilities, etc.

4. Setup the basic environment (*Also vote if we are going to use JS or Java*)

5. Talk a little about programming if we have the time (*Optional*)
